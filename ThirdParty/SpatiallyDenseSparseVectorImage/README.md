Spatially Dense Sparse Vector Image
-----------------------------------

An n-dimensional vector image with a sparse memory model.

The elements for this image are stored in a hash table, catering to very 
large images with a small number of relevant pixels. The image is spatially
dense, allowing fast random access and thread-safe operations.


Getting Started
---------------

Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4 modular system and
to be placed in ITK/Modules/External. Build ITK with the module selected.
