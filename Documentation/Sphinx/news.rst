* Using gh-pages, it is possible to automatically generate some documents, for example, `the list of commands <commands/commandlist.html>`__. 
* As required by a user, ``ComputeSHCoefficientsOfDWIFromSymmetricTensor`` is added to compute a fiber response function from a given symmetric tensor. 
* Some tips using paraview_ is added based on the `discussion <http://www.nitrc.org/pipermail/dmritool-discussion/2015-March/000001.html>`__

Version 0.1.1 is released (03-09-2015)
